    <h1>Analytics In Media</h1>

    <h3>Intro: </h3>
    <p>This project was developed for the purpose of analyzing various kinds of media and why they do/do not connect with individuals based particularly on Dialogue Distribution.</p>

    <h3>Hypothesis: </h3>
    <p>Dialogue must retain a balance of:</p> 
    
    <h3>For Interactive Visual Media (Games & Visual Novels):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>30% Introspective and Personal Thought (Explicitly where character beliefs are challenged or reconsidered or supported)</li>

        <li>10% Exposition (Where a character explicitly states information about the past, present, or future in a matter of fact means)</li>

        <li>10% Direct Opinion (Direct thoughts or ideas expressed by a character, typically a means to convey an opinion directly to the audience)</li>

        <li>30% Reactionary (A character's immediate reaction to an event, without thought or consideration)</li>

        <li>5% Filler (Repeated information or other such lines that could be removed without impacting the flow of the story or information)</li>

        <li>5% Objective (Characters relaying exactly what they intend to do or lines designed to progress the plot)</li>

        <li>10% Player Choice (Selectable choices that actively change the progression of the plot or proceeding dialogues)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Traditional Literature (Novels & Light Novels):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>25% Introspective</li>

        <li>10% Exposition</li>

        <li>10% Direct Opinion</li>

        <li>25% Reactionary</li>

        <li>5% Filler</li>

        <li>5% Objective</li>

        <li>20% Descriptive (Descriptions of places, people, and items, sensory experiences, and other immersive lines)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Film & Non-Interactive Visual Media (Movies & TV):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>30% Introspective</li>

        <li>15% Exposition</li>

        <li>10% Direct Opinion</li>

        <li>30% Reactionary</li>

        <li>5% Filler</li>

        <li>10% Objective</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Null Hypothesis: </h3>
    <p>The emotional engagement of various kinds of media is not reliant on the proportion of dialogue, dialogue proportions simply adjust the pacing and feel of various genres.</p>

    <p>Getting a timeline of how dialogue progresses graphically is more complex, as it requires the timeline segments to be stacked so as not to cause significant GPU lag. It gives a strong indication of how dialogue types are paced throughout a story, however.</p>

        <p>Timeline of how dialogue is distributed throughout Genshin Impact's Natlan Archon Quest Act 3.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Overall, it appears that Genshin Impact's particular dialogue distribution is comparitively oversaturated with Exposition and Opinion, prioritising telling the player  
        what to think rather than letting them come to their own conclusions. This is a common issue expressed with a majority of the playerbase. Characters have also been 
        reported as shallow and one-dimensional, which is heavily supported by the variance in introspection expressed by the characters. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite it's category of being Interactive Media, Genshin Impact's most recent questline has an overall variance of 6.87 (Root Square Mean Error compared to target, max 17 min 0).
    </p>

    <h2>Disco Elysium (Titus to Klaasje)</h2>

        <img src="project1/image5.png" alt="Timeline of Disco Elysium's Dialogue Distribution">
        <p>Timeline of Disco Elysium's dialogue from the Titus to Klaasje arc.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Disco Elysium has a nearly even balance of dialogue types, with less emphasis on direct opinion and no filler.
        There is a significantly high proportion of Player Choice, which echoes player sentiment that Disco Elysium has "too many options"
        although this is a nicer issue to have than the more commonly seen issues of overexpositing or uninteresting characters.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Disco Elysium's Titus to Klaasje story section has an overall variance of 3.12.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>It's clear from these results so far that player engagement is almost directly proportional to the RMSE of dialogue against 
        it's target dialogue distribution. Disco Elysium was a clear contendor for best story, and unsurprisingly has a lower RMSE
        while Genshin Impact has a significantly higher value (3.12 vs 6.87). 
    </p>

    <p>These results are clearly reflected in the sentiments that both critiques and casual players of these games have levied.
        A key surprise as well is the notimation of Disco Elysium as the greatest story game of all time despite having an RMSE of 3.12.
        This appears to indicate that the ideal targets require further refinement or that a mix of the score, plot, or character building 
        have elevated the narrative in the eyes of the public. 

        At present, I tentatively conclude that RMSE's calculated supports my hypothesis. The structure and way a game delivers it's story
        is vital and even predictive to the game's narrative success.
